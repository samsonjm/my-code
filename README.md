This code was written to run single-end RNA-Seq data through a series of
analyses. It was created for  my MSc thesis
in bioinformatics, done at [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Bioinformatics.htm) in Wageningen, Netherlands, under [dr. Harm Nijveen](https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Harm-dr.-H-Harm-Nijveen-B-ICT.htm).
Code in these folders is written in python or R.  prepDE.py was downloaded from
an external source, then updated for python 3.

The folders contain neither data nor config files due to the
confidential nature of the project.
