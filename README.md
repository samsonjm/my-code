## kallisto.py
This code was written to run single-end RNA-Seq data through the
kallisto pipeline. It was written at the beginning of my MSc thesis
in bioinformatics, done at [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Bioinformatics.htm) in Wageningen, Netherlands.
